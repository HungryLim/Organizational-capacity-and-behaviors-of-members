# Organizational Capacity and Candidate Emergence: the Case of Union Members as Candidates for Public Office

# Research Question and Motivation
  # Why Candidate Emergence?
* Candidate emergence is a crucial first step of representation. (Fox and Lawless 2011; Fraga, Juenke and Shah 2020; Maisel and Stone 1997)
* Legislators' personal preferences, experiences, and identities often influence their policy making, accessibility, and representation. (Burden 2007; Carnes 2018; Lowande, Ritchie and Lauterbach 2019)

# Background
  # What explains candidate emergence?
* Strength in numbers
* Both "voter demand" and "candidate supply" sides of candidate emergence literature speak to strength in numbers as predictive of candidate emergence. (Branton 2009; Juenke, Gonzalez, and Shah 2016) 
* The likelihood of minority descriptive representation increases as the district-level minority population increases. (Barreto, Segura, and Woods 2004; Branton 2009;  Lublin 1997)

  # What explains candidate emergence?
* Institutions & organizations
* Organizations can promote political involvement of their members. (Andrews et al. 2010; Brady, Verba, and Schlozman 1995; Tate 2018)
* Parties and interest groups engage in candidate selection and nomination. (See Bawn et al. 2012; Frendreis, Gibson and Vertz 1990; Seligman 1961)
* Elites' personal encouragements (i.e., as organizational incentives) can facilitate people to enter politics. (Broockman 2014; Carnes 2018; Fox and Lawless 2010)

  # Skepticism: Organizations and Institutions?
Whether and how can parties and organizations provide selective incentives to foster candidate emergence? (See Maisel 2001; Carson, Engstrom and Roberts 2007; Cox and Katz 2002)
  
  
# Theory 
Organizations incentivize their members to run with organizational capacity. Then, how does candidate emergence operate within organizations? I argue that organizations can facilitate their members to run for office when organizations incentivize their members by providing political capital (indirect support) and monetary resources (direct support) with their organizational capacity.

# Case Selection: Unions and Candidates with Union Experience (Union Candidates) 
* Political activity of organizations (Ahlquist and Levi, 2013; Jackson and Engel, 2003)
* Variations in organizational activities and capacities at the local level (Becher, Stegmueller and Kappner 2018; Lichtenstein 2013)
* Practicality and transparency (Aaron 1960; Wilcox and Iida 2010)

# Hypotheses
* Unions' aggregated support → Union candidate emergence 
* Unions' direct support → Union candidate emergence 
* Unions' indirect support → Union candidate emergence 

# Data
  # Outcome variable
A binary variable that shows whether there is at least one union candidate who runs for U.S. House primaries in a district or not in 2008, 2010, and 2012

  # Explanatory Variables
* Aggregated Support 
  * Aggregated political spending (logged$)
* Direct Support
  * Political spending (logged $) on campaign contributions, lobbying, and donations
* Indirect support
  * Political spending (logged $) on campaigns and elections, education, training, consulting and professional services, events, and other activities

  # Measuring Indirect and Direct Support
1. Geo-code local unions' addresses and locate them in congressional districts

|Union Name   |Members | Year |Street Address | **RPT ID** |
|-------------|---------|------|--------------|-----------|
|NATIONAL PRODUCTION| 1737 | 2008        | 2210 MIDWEST ROAD  |401105| 
|A M P I EMPLOYEES UNION  |159       | 2008       | 312 CENTER ST        |388379  |
|AERONAUTICAL EXAMINERS     | 187      | 2008       |103 SPRING RIDGE COURT    |406306 |
|AERONAUTICAL EXAMINERS    | 99       | 2008       | 1128 TEBO ROAD|375783|
|AERONAUTICAL EXAMINERS     | 81      | 2008        | ORANGE PARK| 391176 |  
|AFSCME COUNCIL |45      | 2008        | 3325 CAPRICIO STREET NE    | 401148     |
|AGRICULTURE EMPLOYEES        | 3       | 2008        |88 SWEET PEA LANE   | 374355  |

2. Classify each expenditure record

|Disbursement Type| Purpose                            |  Date      |Amount  | **RPT ID** |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|----------|---------|------------|
|504                | 2007 YEAR END AUDIT              | 10/17/2008  | 8300    | 383832  |
|502                | DONATION                         | 2/28/2008   | 10400   | 363172  |
|502                | Election 08' Political Training  | 4/15/2008   | 5587    | 369215  |
|503                | PROMOTIONAL JACKETS              | 10/19/2007  | 6467    | 369259 |

3. Match unions' characteristics data and disbursement data

4. Aggregate these data into congressional district-level during the pre-primary period
   * e.g. For 2010 primary elections, I aggregate spending from 2009 to 2010 ballot access date for primaries
