# Organizational Capacity and Candidate Emergence: the Case of Union Members as Candidates for Public Office

# Research Question and Motivation
  # Why Candidate Emergence?
    * Candidate emergence is a crucial first step of representation. (Fox and Lawless 2011; Fraga, Juenke and Shah 2020; Maisel and Stone 1997)
    * Legislators' personal preferences, experiences, and identities often influence their policy making, accessibility, and representation. (Burden 2007; Carnes 2018; Lowande, Ritchie and Lauterbach 2019)

# Background
  # What explains candidate emergence?
    * Strength in numbers
    * Both "voter demand" and "candidate supply" sides of candidate emergence literature speak to strength in numbers as predictive of candidate emergence. (Branton 2009; Juenke, Gonzalez, and Shah 2016) 
    * The likelihood of minority descriptive representation increases as the district-level minority population increases. (Barreto, Segura, and Woods 2004; Branton 2009;  Lublin 1997)

  # What explains candidate emergence?
    * Institutions & organizations
    * Organizations can promote political involvement of their members. (Andrews et al. 2010; Brady, Verba, and Schlozman 1995; Tate 2018)
    * Parties and interest groups engage in candidate selection and nomination. (See Bawn et al. 2012; Frendreis, Gibson and Vertz 1990; Seligman 1961)
    * Elites' personal encouragements (i.e., as organizational incentives) can facilitate people to enter politics. (Broockman 2014; Carnes 2018; Fox and Lawless 2010)
